Description: Layer-3 Mesh Routing Protocol
 BMX6 is a IPv6-based mesh routing protocol that supports the dynamic and
 autonomous establishment of end-to-end routes between network nodes based
 on a given physical topology of links and link qualities.
 .
 BMX6 leverages principles of table-driven, proactive, destination-sequenced
 distant-vector (DSDV) routing where sequenced routing updates, originated
 by each node of a network and updated and re-broadcasted by each hop, are
 used to propagate path cost and versioning information in the network.
 In contrast to the traditional DSDV protocol, containing an IP address to
 identify a particular node of the network, the routing update of BMX6
 uses only a verifiably reference to the destination node's description.
 This way, routing information can be combined with the announcement of other
 networking services and name spaces such as addresses, hostname, tunnel, and
 path-metric parameters.
 .
 Compared to Internet routing protocols (such as OSPF, BGP, IS-IS) BMX6 is
 more tailored for mesh and ad-hoc networks and provides autonomous link-,
 and neighbor- discovery.
 Compared to other mesh routing protocols (such as OLSR, batman-adv, babel)
 BMX6 comes with a much more flexible configuration freedom and a very small
 protocol data overhead.
 Compared to many existing overlay-network and VPN solutions (such as OpenVPN,
 Tinc, TOR, fastd, IPSec) BMX6 could provide the base end-to-end IP-routing
 infrastructure that such solutions depend on.
